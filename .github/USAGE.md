If you don't want to specify a specific version anymore, you can simply press the button and select **"Cancel and reset"**.

## Bedrock edition
Keep in mind that the Java -> Bedrock support is still in beta phase, and therefore many things are not implemented <br>
yet and there is no guarantee that everything will work as it should.
