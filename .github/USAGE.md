In the Add/Edit Server screen there is a button where you can select a specific version for this server, when you ping or connect to this server, 
ViaFabricPlus will use the version set there, the versions are stored in the servers.dat too

If you don't want to specify a specific version anymore, you can simply press the button and select **"Cancel and reset"**.

### Settings are optional settings that can turn fixes on and off, originally they were used for debugging<br>

## Bedrock edition
Keep in mind that the Java -> Bedrock support is still in beta phase, and therefore many things are not implemented
yet and there is no guarantee that everything will work as it should.

To log in to a Bedrock account you can press the button **"Click to set account for Bedrock edition"** in the settings,
then you can log in via device login, the account logged in there will be stored in **~/ViaFabricPlus/bedrock.account**.

## ClassiCube and BetaCraft integration
In the main GUI there is an extra button for ClassiCube and BetaCraft, both buttons send API requests to the respective platforms to get the respective server list.

## ClassiCube

For ClassiCube you need an account, which you can make on the official website (https://www.classicube.net/), in case ClassiCube requires MultiFactor, an extra GUI will open in ViaFabricPlus.
