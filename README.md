# ViaFabricPlus
Clientside ViaVersion, ViaLegacy and ViaAprilFools implementation with clientside fixes for Fabric

## Why?
Originally ViaFabricPlus was not a standalone project but a part of my Minecraft Utility Mod, <br>
since this is no longer existent I am now developing the Protocol Translation part as a standalone mod, <br>
and now: ViaFabricPlus is here

## Project structure
ViaFabricPlus splits into two major parts:
| Part                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ViaFabricPlus           | Core of the project, all fixes here are stable and have been tested many times                                                                                                                                                         |
| ViaFabricPlus-Visual    | Addon for the core, it adds only visual changes between the versions like old textures, <br>optional and not necessary for the gameplay, but recommended.                                                                              |

## Values
Values are optional settings that can turn fixes on and off, originally they were used for debugging, the Values GUI works like this: <br>
Left mouse click activates/deactivates a Value, right mouse click activates a Sync Mode in which the Value is activated or deactivated depending on the version it belongs to.
